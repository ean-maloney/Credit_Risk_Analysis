# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview
In this analysis I test the successfulness of several machine learning models to at predicting the risk status of loans based on a large number of criteria from LendingClub's credit card dataset.

## Results
Displayed below are the balanced accuracy, precision, and recall for each model where a high risk loan is defined as a true positive result.

### Model 1: Naive Random Oversampling
* precision: .01
* recall : .57
* balanced accuracy: .61

### Model 2: SMOTE Oversampling
* precision: .01
* recall: .64
* balanced accuracy: .64

### Model 3: Cluster Centroids Undersampling
* precision: .00
* recall: .51
* balanced accuracy: .50 

### Model 4: SMOTEEN
* precision: .01
* recall: .77
* balanced accuracy: .67

### Model 5: Balanced Random Forest
* precision: .03
* recall: .60
* balanced accuracy: .76

### Model 6: Easy Ensemble AdaBoost
* precision: .07
* recall: .94
* balanced accuracy: .95
